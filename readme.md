# Doggo Defender

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Doggo defender is a small wave defense game made over a weekend.
It was like a game jam, but with only two participants. The idea was:
- We pick an asset pack from https://www.kenney.nl/ (together)
- We brainstorm one game idea (together)
- Then we both set out alone to make the same game with the same assets, and see how we diverged

It actually turned out quite well. I wouldn't normally be that interested in wave defense style games, but despite the simple gameplay and limited scope, I think it ended up being pretty fun.
